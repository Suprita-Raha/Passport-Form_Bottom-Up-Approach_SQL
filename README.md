# **BOTTOM-UP APPROACH** Passport Application Database Design

This project involves the creation of a relational database structure for managing passport applications, using a bottom-up approach. The database is designed to capture and manage comprehensive details related to applicants, their family, emergency contacts, criminal proceedings, address, and other critical information required in the passport application process. The design ensures that all relevant data points from the application form are systematically organized and can be efficiently retrieved and managed.

## Bottom-Up Approach

The bottom-up approach was adopted for designing this database structure. In this methodology, the design process begins at the most granular level by identifying specific data fields found in the passport application form. These data fields are then grouped into logical entities. By working upwards from the data points to form entities and relationships, this approach ensures that the database design precisely aligns with the actual data captured in the form. This method ensures high fidelity between the form data and the database structure, allowing for accurate and efficient data management.

Relationship:

1. **Applicant to FamilyDetails**: This is a **one-to-one relationship**. Each applicant (`ApplicantID` in `applicant` table) has a single set of family details (`ApplicantID` in `familydetails` table).

2. **Applicant to EmergencyContact**: This is a **one-to-many relationship**. An applicant (`ApplicantID` in `applicant` table) can have multiple emergency contacts (`ApplicantID` in `emergencycontact` table).

3. **Applicant to Passport**: This is a **one-to-one relationship**. Each applicant (`ApplicantID` in `applicant` table) can have one passport (`ApplicantID` in `passport` table).

4. **Applicant to CriminalProceedings**: This is a **one-to-many relationship**. An applicant (`ApplicantID` in `applicant` table) can have multiple criminal proceedings (`ApplicantID` in `criminalproceedings` table).
